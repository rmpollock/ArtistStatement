#Series of functions returning text of my statement

def statement():
	print "I make prints and other stuff."
	return "This is my artist statement written in Python. My process is algorithmic in nature and involves the use of geometric fractal patterns and impossible objects as the basis for my compositions that combine these elements with stylized nature elements."

def fractals():
	return "Factal Definition \nA curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. Fractals are useful in modeling structures (such as eroded coastlines or snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth, fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation."

def PenroseObjects():
	return "Penrose Polygons \nA 2-dimensional representation of a 3-dimensional polygon that cannot exist in normal three dimensional space."
def NaturalThings():
	print "I like trees and stuff they are pretty cool."
	return "I use natural objects within my compositions composed of fractcals and impossible objects to create a fantasical world that cannot exist outside of a two dimensional image."

def SystemError():
	print "You can't 3d print impossible object silly!"
	return "System Error! \nFunction impossible to execute!"
